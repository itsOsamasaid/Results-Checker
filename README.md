# Overview

In this project, I was tired of checking results every few seconds. So, I started working on this script.
this script was written in python to web scrape my university results website and check if there's a new result so it can notify me by sending me an email.
Initially, I self hosted this script on my labtop but i found that it's not handy. So, I looked for a free hosting providers. At the I chose HERUKO.
